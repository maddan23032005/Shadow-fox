ShadowFox Internship – AI/ML Projects
 
Welcome to my internship project repository for the ShadowFox AI/ML Internship.  
This repo includes all the tasks, mini-projects, and deliverables I’ve completed during the internship — along with proof of work, clean code, and real-world ML applications.

Internship Overview

As an AI/ML Intern at ShadowFox, I'm gaining hands-on experience working on real-time machine learning tasks.  

The focus is on:
1) Writing clean, production-ready code
2) Applying core ML concepts like preprocessing, model evaluation, and deployment
3) Creating interactive apps (like using Streamlit)
4) Documenting everything in GitHub and showcasing Proof of Work (PoW) on LinkedIn
